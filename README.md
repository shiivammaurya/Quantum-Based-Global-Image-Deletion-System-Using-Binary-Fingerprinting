🧠 Quantum Image Deletion System 🔒🌐

Global Image Blocking | Deepfake Detection | Quantum-Powered Privacy

The Quantum Image Deletion System is a futuristic privacy solution that ensures that once a user deletes an image, it becomes invisible everywhere — across all devices, platforms, and networks.
Instead of deleting the file, the system blocks the image from being displayed, using pHash + UID + quantum parallel blocking.

🚀 Features
🧩 Unique Binary Fingerprinting (UID)

Every image gets a tamper-proof UID using
pHash + device metadata + timestamp + source tag.

⚡ Quantum-Powered Global Blocking

QPU sends parallel block signals, making the image invisible on:

Phones
Laptops
Cloud Storage
Social Media
Screenshots / Edited Versions

🧠 Deepfake & Fake Image Detection

AI layer detects:

Deepfakes

AI-generated images

Morphed offensive media

🔗 Full Traceability (Who Shared What)

Tracks an image from:
Primary Device → Secondary → Tertiary → Internet Uploads
Helps identify the first uploader and every sharer.

📵 Display-Level Blocking (Not File Deletion)

Blocks image at GPU/display layer →
Stored but cannot be opened, viewed, or screenshotted.

🌐 Internet-Wide Monitoring

Quantum search detects replicas across:

Websites

Social media

Cloud servers

Dark web mirrors

📴 Offline Device Handling

If a device is offline, the system queues the UID and blocks automatically when it reconnects.

🛠️ How It Works
Stage 1: UID Creation

Photo captured

System generates pHash + metadata

Creates UID → stored in Quantum Registry

Stage 2: Sharing & Replicas

On sharing, receiving device checks pHash

If ≥70% similar → linked to same UID chain

Stage 3: Quantum Monitoring

QPU scans global networks

Detects replicas ≥50% similarity

Logs IP/server as a new chain node

Stage 4: Quantum Image Blocking Protocol (QIBP)

User selects Delete →
QPU sends parallel block signals →
Image becomes invisible everywhere in seconds.

🧾 Patent Information

Title: Quantum-Based Global Image Deletion System Using Binary Fingerprinting
Inventors: Shivam, Shivanshu, Pranjal Rai, Pranav Vachespati
Category: Patent (Filed)
Institution: Chandigarh University

💡 Why This System Matters

As deepfakes and offensive photo misuse rise, this system ensures:

✔ Full ownership & control of personal images
✔ Identification of the original uploader
✔ Deepfake detection to prevent fake media spread
✔ Global blocking of offensive content
✔ Legal traceability for cybercrime departments

This innovation solves a real digital-era problem — once an image goes online, we finally have a way to control it.
